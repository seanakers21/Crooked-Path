            <h2>Community Jumpscare</h2>
            <p>
            The Crooked Path is a free, family-friendly jump-scare attraction founded on the principles of Proverbs 14:12:  
            "A way seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death."  
            In our hearts, we naturally have an idea of what we think is right.  
            The problem is that we have all gone astray from the truth of God and created our own “truth,”  
            which actually leads us to our own destruction.
            </p>
            <p>
            Going along with this theme, guests walk through an ominous environment cloaked in darkness,
            while ghastly fiends lie in wait! Instead of people dressed in costume, the attraction is populated
            entirely with custom-made props, operated by volunteers in hidden control rooms, to give a more convincing experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            Our desire is to make God’s truth known through this unique outreach and we hope you find it to be frightfully entertaining!
